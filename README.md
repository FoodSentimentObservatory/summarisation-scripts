# summarisation-scripts
Scripts to process the jst data into a more meaningful and readable format

## Prerequisites

Sample config file available. 

Need to create a data directory for all input and results folder for the output

### Input files

The summarisations uses for input 5 items: 4 text files: documentThetha, documentPi, topicWords and topicSentences and a folder with raw-tweets which contains raw texts generated by the raw-tweets.py script in pyMysql. 

The four text files mentioned above are copied from the jst final results and pasted and saved in txt format. 

**Note:** do not change the extention of the jst files themselves, as this ruins their formatting. 

## Running the code

Run **summary_of_topics.py** in a console.

**Note:** After each run of the script make sure to copy the result files to a different directory or give them a relevant name as currently the code cannot generate useful names and it simply overwrites the result files.

## Output files

* json file to be used for visualisation of summaries in html

* text file of all topic summaries

* spreadsheet of all topic summaries, ordered by topic importance

* spreadsheet of all topics, ordered by importance

* csv file of all topics
