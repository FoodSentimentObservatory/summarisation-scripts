# summarisation-scripts

Sample config file available\n
The summarisations uses for input 5 items: 4 text files: documentThetha, documentPi, topicWords and topicSentences and a folder with raw-tweets which contains raw texts generated by the raw-tweets.py script in pyMysql. The four text files mentioned above are copied from the jst final results and pasted and saved in txt format. Note: do not change the extention of the jst files themselves, as this ruins their formatting. 
Missing data directory which contains the input files, the raw tweets should be stored in a folder inside the data directory and results directory which will contain all the resulting files
